# FLARP
PACE Hackweek 2024 project: FLARP (FLuorescence Analysis and Research with PACE)

Main code: 'FLARP_project_pres.ipynb'

INPUT DATA:
'float_profile_info.csv' and 'float_profile_info_na_final.csv'

IMPORTANT: Float data provided in this example are unvalidated and have not been quality controlled. This should be used for demostration purposes only. Once the data from the dual fluoresence sensors are included in the BGC Argo monthly snapshots from Seanoe, they will be open for use, until then use with extreme caution and assume these results are bogus.

Contact Jacki Long (jacki@submarine.earth) with questions.
